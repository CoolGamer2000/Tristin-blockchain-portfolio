# ResilientSA Smart Contract Idea

This smart contract will let users offer basic services in exchange for RZA tokens.

## Scenario
A user wants to offer "1 hour of tutoring" for 50 RZA tokens.

## How it works (Plain English):
1. A buyer sends 50 RZA tokens to the smart contract.
2. The contract holds the tokens (escrow).
3. After the service is completed, the service provider (e.g. tutor) confirms it.
4. Tokens are released to the provider.
5. If not confirmed in a set time, the buyer can request a refund.
