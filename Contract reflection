# Reflection

I learned how smart contracts work by exploring real examples on Ethereum.  
It was interesting to see how functions like `mint()` and `transfer()` work in real projects.  
I realized smart contracts are powerful tools for trust without middlemen.  
Escrow stood out to me because it protects both sides in a deal.  
Now I feel more confident about building blockchain tools for the community.
